## üìù Abstract

Data transformation is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning that significantly influences model performance. This study explores the impact of various transformation techniques‚Äîincluding normalization, standardization, encoding, and log transformation‚Äîon classification performance across multiple real-world datasets. We assess accuracy, training time, and algorithm behavior for models like logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, k-NN, and random forests.
